## Synopsis

This is a simple Meteor wrapper for the Bitfinex REST API. The goal is to make a super simple way for Meteor apps to interact with Bitfinex.

## Installation
```
meteor add mjr:bitfinex-api

```

# Quick Start
Once you have added the package, you will have an object called bitfinex available. This object can use all of the unauthenticated calls right off the bat.
